# Employee Performance Dashboard

## Project Overview
This is a full-stack Python web application for tracking employee performance metrics.  
It allows managers and HR teams to monitor employee productivity, tasks completed, performance scores, and last review dates.  

The dashboard provides an easy-to-use interface to **add employees**, **view metrics**, and **export employee data to JSON**.  
It uses **Flask** for the backend, **SQLite** for storage, and standard HTML/JS for the frontend.
